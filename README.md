# Bank Loan Financial Risk Analysis (MySQL)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of bank loans to evaluate financial risk, portfolio health, and customer segmentation. By utilizing MySQL, I extracted key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess loan conditions, regional demand, and interest rate trends. 

## Key Features & SQL Techniques Demonstrated
* **Aggregate Functions:** `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`.
* **Financial Calculations:** Outstanding balances, loan distribution percentages, and good vs. bad loan ratios.
* **Data Grouping & Sorting:** `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` for regional and term-based segmentation.
* **Subqueries:** Utilized for calculating dynamic portfolio percentages.

## Files in this Repository
* `financial_analysis.sql`: Contains the complete set of queries used to clean, segment, and analyze the financial data.

## Business Questions Answered
* What is the total funded amount and average interest rate of the portfolio?
* What is the precise percentage breakdown of Good vs. Bad loans?
* How does home ownership status impact the volume of loans distributed?
* What is the remaining outstanding balance of the bank's loan portfolio?
* Which regions generate the highest volume of loan demand?
